     <span class="text-primary fw-bold">Patient-volunter</span>

     Volunteers can offer an additional ‘human touch’ in the business of health care. They often spend time talking and listening to patients, and are a valuable non-clinical confidante for those who feel vulnerable or isolated. They perform a range of tasks, including sharing their own experiences and stories with patients, gathering information for them, and providing help to eat and drink. Many patients we spoke to suggested their care was all the better for having the support of a volunteer.
