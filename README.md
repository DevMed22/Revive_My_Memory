# Project Overview

- This project aims to address the memory-related challenges faced by elderly individuals, specifically those aged 50 to 90, who struggle with recalling old memories and experience memory loss due to lifestyle factors that can lead to mild cognitive impairment (MCI) or Alzheimer's disease. To mitigate these difficulties and improve their quality of life, we have developed a Deep Learning Model, Website, and Mobile application. 

- The mobile application serves as a comprehensive memory assistance tool for MCI or Alzheimer's patients, providing them and their families with valuable resources and support. Users can access important information, manage daily activities, and track medication adherence through the application. Additionally, the app facilitates communication between patients and dedicated volunteers, enhancing language recall and social interaction through video chat functionality. 

- The website enhances the project by providing a platform that facilitates the mission of doctors in assisting patients. Doctors can access the website to review patient data, conduct video conferences with patients and their families, and make informed decisions regarding their care. 

- The website also integrates an advanced artificial intelligence (AI) model capable of detecting various types of Alzheimer's disease and mild cognitive impairment. This model analyzes patient MRI scans to predict the presence and progression of these conditions, further assisting doctors in providing accurate diagnoses and personalized treatment plans.
